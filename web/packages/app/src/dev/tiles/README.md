# Development evaluation tiles

Development evaluation only, never served in production. These are pinned golden bakes, not
product inputs. The app's development preview route loads one by name
(`?preview=1&tile=<name>`), and `test/generated-tile-evaluation.test.ts` builds the app and proves
that no production build emits these bytes or the code that reads them.

## `tile-conformance.owd`

- Source: `web/packages/loom-tess/test/fixtures/tile-conformance.json`, tess's conformance tile.
- Made with, from `web/`:

  ```bash
  pnpm tess bake packages/loom-tess/test/fixtures/tile-conformance.json packages/app/src/dev/tiles/tile-conformance.owd
  ```

- sha256: `b8bdf3efe4d4183bafb093847a897d957f02bcfa1c953c238b2760ccfca4dfe4` (198,280 bytes).
- render_batch triangle digest: `9f81d75aed01d07b09703d6367f59cf12862ce1ec652c9dfb362a70a539b4e05`,
  the value tess's own conformance test pins.

`test/generated-tile-golden.test.ts` rebakes the source through tess's bake command and requires
these bytes exactly, so a tess change that moves the golden fails there. Rebake this file in the
same change that moves the fixture.
