# Development evaluation tiles

Development evaluation only, never served in production. These are pinned golden bakes, not
product inputs. The app's development preview route loads one by name
(`?preview=1&tile=<name>`), and `test/generated-tile-evaluation.test.ts` builds the app and proves
that no production build emits these bytes or the code that reads them.

## `tile-conformance.owd`

- Source: `web/packages/loom-tess/test/fixtures/tile-conformance.json`, tess's conformance tile.
- Made with, from `web/`:

  ```bash
  pnpm tess bake packages/loom-tess/test/fixtures/tile-conformance.json packages/app/src/dev/tiles/tile-conformance.owd
  ```

- sha256: `03f3f423551b746a35abcad157abadf0e0ccd7cfe3aa5ec643f9866ab597acb8` (198,264 bytes).
- render_batch triangle digest: `6cf002aa288b934cf12518126f170906ec62da79e81490bb4d970a74d06abb09`,
  the value tess's own conformance test pins.

`test/generated-tile-golden.test.ts` rebakes the source through tess's bake command and requires
these bytes exactly, so a tess change that moves the golden fails there. Rebake this file in the
same change that moves the fixture.
